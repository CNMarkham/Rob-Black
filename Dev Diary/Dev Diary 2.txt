# Dev Diary 2

Planning: Wrote out comments to plan each section of code then implemented them when I thought it was sufficiently logical.

Implemented: C#, Dictionaries, Lists, GameObjects, Classes & a large central Index script

Modified: Some things have been removed from the original implementation; the fish no longer have arms and the place holder real-life images have been replaced with more interesting & sophisticated 1800s scientific diagrams (Public Domain)

Challenges faced:

- Trying, implementing and fixing the room generation system

	- There were many points throughout in which there were problems I had trouble fixing
	- There was one time when the rooms only existed once they were observed, like collapsing a wave function of quantum particle by interacting with it

	- Otherwise the comments were a lot of help because they described what code *should* be doing
	- If a comment contradicted the code, the code must have been changed

Challenges that will be faced:

- Assets may take a while to implement
